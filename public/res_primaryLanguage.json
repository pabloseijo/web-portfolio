Originally from Ferrol, Galicia, I actively participate in team-based projects such as Evolutia.dev (automation) and Meditracker (medication tracking). My main interests are in developing my own projects, automation using artificial intelligence, and network management. I primarily work with macOS and Ubuntu Server environments. I'm open to collaborating on initiatives that align with my technical interests.",
